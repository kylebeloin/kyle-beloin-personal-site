      Currently, I'm a frontend developer with a degree in Applied Computing and
      Informatics from the University of Arizona (Fall 2021).

      <br />
      As a tech transplant with backgrounds in Philosophy (BA, 2013) and English
      Literature (MA, 2018), I love learning&mdash;plain and simple. This
      industry (and frontend development in particular) has proven to be the
      ideal field to help scratch that "lifelong student" itch.
